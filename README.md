# CSE374s_MarsRoverProject
 In this project, we’ll do computer vision for robotics.  We are going to build a Sample & Return Rover in  simulation. Mainly, we’ll control the robot from images  streamed from a camera mounted on the robot. The  project aims to do autonomous mapping and  navigation given an initial map of the environment.  Realistically speaking, the hard work is done now that  you have the mapping component! You will have the  option to choose whether to send orders like the  throttle, brake, pickup rocks and steering with each new image the  rover's camera produces
